# 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming Term Project -- Pendo

## Project Description:
The name of the project is Pendo. This is a 2.5D tile sliding game. The player needs to move a ball on a 2.5D view plane, from the starting position to the target position on the plane. There would be several gaps randomly generated in the board according to the difficulty level and the player needs to fill in the gap by dragging different tiles to the board and create a path for the ball to roll to the target position. The player can either play existing levels or create new levels themselves, and this game also allows the player to save and load levels he/she created.
